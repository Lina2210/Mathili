Quien Quiere Ser Millonario?
This project by Lina, Martí and Tianle is based on the famous Spanish TV show "¿Quien Quiere Ser Millonario?" but in web page format, executed on the server.
The game is about answering different questions at different levels and earning money, in our case just for fun, there is no reward. 
In order to play the game 
	- First download PHP:
		- Windows: for Windows you need to download PHP from the official website: https://windows.php.net/download/
		- GNU/Linux Debian/Ubuntu: for these platforms you have to type "$ sudo apt install php" in the terminal.
	- To run the program, go to the project folder and type "php index.php" in the Windows terminal (if this does not work, you may need to write the complete path of PHP), in the case of Ubuntu or other variants, type "php -S 0:8080" or any other address.
	- Finally, go to "localhost:8080/index.php" and you will be able to read the instructions and then play the game.
